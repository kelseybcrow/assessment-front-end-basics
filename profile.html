        <p>I wish this picture was of me haha. I love this girl's aesthetic.</p>

          I've also been really into the retro color-block style. It goes really
          well with longboard fashion, too.

        <h1>I just got into longboarding</h1>
        <p>
          I never would have thought that I would get into longboarding, but my
          husband had the idea and I tried it with him and now I totally love
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've done a lot of rock climbing and yoga in the past, but it's been
          too inconvenient lately to drive to the climbing gym or the yoga
          studio. I love longboarding because I can do it anywhere. I also love
          that it has a similar feeling in the body of full-body-awareness and
          balancing, the way that rock climbing and yoga did. I also love the
          fashion and culture surrounding longboarding.
